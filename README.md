Not My Food

## Overview
This app started from a group Hackathon project during my schooling in BrainStation. The goal of the project was to showcase our understanding in Rest Apis by using axios library to make api calls along with developing a functional and visually appealing web application within the given time or 5 hours.

### Problem Space
This app can be used to check whether a movie is worth watching or recommended. And from the start or home page, users are given three top recommended movies to watch which were indivually picked by the hackathon group members.

### User Profile
